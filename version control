Analysis steps:
1- Construct first and second order data sets, second order contains interaction terms
2- Run 10-fold cross validation 100x (lasso) and run variable importance 100x (rf)
3- Extract ranks from each model, frequency of feature selection (lasso) and relative variable importance in terms of RSS (rf)
4- Run rank product to get feature ranks

Version Control:

v3: did 4-fold cross-validation on lasso (still using cv.glmnet)
v4: Added noExtrap models, will later become THE quadratic model
v5: 6 models, run again to double-check the results
v6: removed quadratic models that had extrapolation, back to 4 models, 2 linear, 2 quad with noExtrap
v7: Implemented extrenally-controlled cross-validation in random forests
v8: Implement externally-controlled cv in lasso and use glmnet. control picked model using model$dev.ratio reaching 95% (still 4 fold, 100 repeats)
v9: Implement LOO-CV
v10: Implement 100 repeats of 13 fold cv (leave 2 out)
v11: only lasso. best it can do for 4 fold cv (100 repeats)
v12: only lasso. best it can do for LOO-cv (1 repeat)
v13: only lasso. best it can do for 13 fold cv (100 repeats)
